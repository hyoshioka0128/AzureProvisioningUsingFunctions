## Setup & Prerequisites
Using the steps below you will be able to create all prerequisites and resources required by the solution.


### Create App Registration
Registering your application establishes a trust relationship between your app and the Microsoft identity platform. The trust is unidirectional: your app trusts the Microsoft identity platform, and not the other way around.

Follow these steps to create the app registration:

	1. Sign in to the Azure portal.
	2. Search for and select Azure Active Directory.
	3. Under Manage, select App registrations > New registration.
	4. Enter a display Name for your application. Users of your application might see the display name when they use the app, for example during sign-in. 
	5. Note the automatically generated Application (client) ID.
	6. Don't enter anything for Redirect URI.
	7. Select Register to complete the initial app registration.
	8. Select from left menu of the app created Certificates & secrets > Client secrets > New client secret.
	9. Add a description for your client secret.
	10. Select an expiration for the secret or specify a custom lifetime.
	11. Select Add.
	12. Record the secret's value for use in your client application code. This secret value is never displayed again after you leave this page.




### Authorize app access to Azure Active Directory

	1. From the created app, select from left menu of the app created API Authorization.
	2. Add Graph Authorization: User.ReadWrite.All, LicenseAssignment.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Group.Create
	3. Provide Admin consent for the authorizations



### Create Azure Function environment
	1. From the Azure portal menu or the Home page, select Create a resource.
	2. In the New page, select Compute > Function App.
	3. On the Basics page, complete the function app settings.
	4. on others pages, complete the function app settings.
	5. Select Review + create to review the app configuration selections.
	6. On the Review + create page, review your settings, and then select Create to provision and deploy the function app.
	7. Select the Notifications icon in the upper-right corner of the portal and watch for the Deployment succeeded message.
	8. Select Go to resource to view your new function app.
	9. Select the Configuration page from the left menu of the create app.
	10. Select New Application setting and add the entries reported in the table below.


|Name                    |Value                                       |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
|_secret:clientId        | Enter the ClientID created previously      |
|_secret:clientSecret    | Enter the clientSecret created previously  |
|_secret:tenantId        | Enter the tenantId                         |

### Deploy Azure Functions
Deploy Azure Functions for example using Visual Studio.


## Usage
